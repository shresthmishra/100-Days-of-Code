# Functions in Python

"""
In Python, functions are blocks of organized, reusable code designed to perform a specific, related action. 
They are fundamental to structuring programs effectively, promoting code reusability, and enhancing readability.

# Defining a Function:
Functions are defined using the def keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses that may contain parameters, and a colon. 
The function's body is indented below the line.
